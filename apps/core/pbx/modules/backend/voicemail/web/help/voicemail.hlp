<h1>{$node_name}</h1>

<p>The option “Voicemails” of the Menu “PBX” in Elastix lets us view a list with details of the voicemails for the extension of a connected user.</p>

<p>The report will change depending on the values of the filter:</p>

<table class="inline">

  <tr>
    <td>Start Date</td><td>Start date for the selection of voicemails.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>End Date</td><td>End date for the selection of voicemails.</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p>The user can only configure the "voicemail" if a user is assigned by Elastix's extension.</p>
