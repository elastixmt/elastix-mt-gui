<h1>{$node_name}</h1>

<p>The option “Fax Visor” of the Menu “Fax” in Elastix lets us view a list with details of the faxes received.</p>

<div><img src="../modules/{$node_id}/images/fax_visor.jpg" border="0"></div>

<br />

<p>Besides this, we have the option to download the fax in PDF format, by clicking on the desired file in the list of faxes received.</p>

<p>The report will change depending on the values of the filter:</p>

<table class="inline">
  <tr>
    <td>Company Name</td><td>Name of the company that is sending the fax.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Company Fax</td><td>Number of the Fax of the company that is sending the fax.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Fax Date</td><td>Sent date of fax.</td>
  </tr>
</table>
