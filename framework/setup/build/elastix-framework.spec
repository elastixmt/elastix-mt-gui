  SVN Rev[5061]

* Thu Jun 06 2013 Alex Villacis Lasso <a_villacis@palosanto.com>
- CHANGED: Framework: lay foundation to remove some boilerplate from all Elastix
  modules:
  - All modules need to load their i18n strings. Currently every module either
    calls load_language_module() or uses require() directly to load the PHP
    strings. The framework will now load the i18n strings for the module.
    Duplicate loading of strings is harmless, so old modules can remain as-is.
  - All modules need to load their default.conf.php file. Just like the language
    files, the framework now loads the configuration for the module.
  - All modules need to get the custom template directory for forms and such.
    A framework function, getTemplatesDirModule(), has been created for this.
  - Finally, many modules use the convention that class XYZ is defined in the
    file XYZ.class.php. The framework can now support this convention to
    implement autoloading, so that modules do not need to require() every single
    class file anymore.

  framework will enable a number of optimizations to improve performance in the
  ARM environment. Currently setting this flag disables tracking of menu history
  and enables caching of authorized modules in the session variable
  'elastix_user_permission'.

  functions get_key_settings and set_key_settings to use the changed column
  name.

- CHANGED: Framework: reimplement several widget helper methods to receive the
  database connection used for authentication instead of opening a duplicate.
  SVN Rev[4873]
- CHANGED: Framework: reimplement putMenuAsBookmark to receive additional
  parameters of database connections, instead of opening duplicates.
  SVN Rev[4872]
- CHANGED: Framework: reorganization of menu management and theme encapsulation:
  - The implementation of paloSantoNavigation has been rewritten and
    considerably simplified. The previous implementation maintained the menu
    items as a simple list with parents weakly linked through the IdParent
    property, and every query of the children of such items required a walk of
    the entire node list. This walk, as well as the walk required to choose the
    module to display given the menu item, were open-coded through the
    implementation and involved several node copies. The new implementation
    builds references between parents and children in the constructor, and then
    relies mainly on these references to select the module to display. This
    allows the menu walk to be implemented once, to be shorter, and the overall
    code to be considerably simplified.
  - The menu walking code does not assume a maximum menu depth. This removes
    several kludges (mainly in showContent) that stemmed from the previous
    implementation assuming a two-level menu and then hurriedly adapted to
    support three-level menus.
  - The menu node assignment has been unified. Since the nodes have children
    lists and the HasChild property is actively maintained, themes no longer
    require a separate menu list for second-level menu decorations. This affects
    the elastixneo and elastixwave themes.
  - Second-level popup menu tables have been pushed into the themes where they
    belong. This affects the following themes: al elastixwine giox slashdot.
  - Theme-specific menu manipulation (elastixneo) has been abstracted out of
    paloSantoNavigation and into a new per-theme library inside themesetup.php.
  - Several widget-rendering operations that require database access have also
    been abstracted out of paloSantoNavigation and index.php. Since the only
    theme that makes use of these widgets is elastixneo, the calls have been
    moved into its themesetup.php file.
  - The modified index.php no longer assigns the selected menu item to a session
    variable. This may break some addons that depend on this.
  SVN Rev[4871]

* Sun Apr 28 2013 Alex Villacis Lasso <a_villacis@palosanto.com>
- CHANGED: Framework: move implementation of loadShortcut out of

- CHANGED: Framework: move changePasswordElastix functionality to elastixutils.
  SVN Rev[4859]
- ADDED: Framework: introduce hidden module _elastixutils. This module will
  contain various utilities for widgets in the Elastix Web GUI. This allows
  a cleanup of index.php, by removing functionality that does not belong in
  the router and authorization code. As a proof of concept, the package version
  query was moved to _elastixutils. In the process, the query was reimplemented
  to issue a single rpm command instead of multiple ones, and achieving a 50%
  speedup. This also makes /usr/bin/versionPaquetes.sh obsolete so it is now
  removed.

- ADDED: Framework: introduce elastix-helper.
  This program (elastix-helper) is intended to be a single point of
  entry for operations started from the web interface that require
  elevated privileges. The program must be installed as
  /usr/sbin/elastix-helper and invoked via the wrapper
  /usr/bin/elastix-helper which closes extra file descriptors with
  /usr/sbin/close-on-exec.pl and adds the sudo invocation.
  As extra file descriptors past STDIN/STDOUT/STDERR are closed via
  the intended invocation, helper programs should not rely on any
  file descriptors being open other than the standard ones.
  Packages should install helper programs in
  /usr/share/elastix/privileged. All communication should be
  performed via command-line parameters. SVN Rev[2683]
